This is an iOS app that uses accelerometer data to identify "potholes" in a community. Data is sent to a backend service, which parses all of the data, identifies them and then opens up a public API with this data, allowing other developers to make applications using it. We hope that something like this could lead to apps that can speed up the time needed for teams to respond to major pothole issues, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in vehicular and extensive road repairs.
